                <p>
                    Accurateness and cautiousness are the key traits that I have taken away from mathematics.
    I am always aware of potential problems and am cautious to keep an eye out for those problems.
    I have a strong passion for developing programs. With logic from math, I can handle most situations within the requirements of programs. Math has also aspired me to be perfect.
    I love to find small mistakes that could have led to big failure. It brings me a sense of accomplishment.
    I have participated and handled many program development projects related to duty-free warehouse systems and completed the mission objectives. Working with others and coordinating resources are my talents.
